              Every mountain will teach us patience, persistence, and gratitude, it teaches us to enjoy the small luxuries in life,
                to be positive, and We will make new friends due to the bond and similar goals.
                 Mountain climbing, also known as mountaineering or alpinism, is an activity for 
                 people who like to climb mountains up to their summit. This activity requires perseverance, 
                 high technical skills, and fitness level.  Mountain climbers often are physically and mentally prepared,
                  have a high level of confidence, and are able to survive and adapt to harsh conditions.  Most importantly,
                   people can take part in this activity and they have to have the best equipment. A backpack consisting of 
                   sufficient pieces of equipment such as an ice ax, boots with crampons, rope, ice screws, mountaineering food,
                    gloves, gaiters, and sunglasses which may weigh up to 30kg. Let's not forget, mountain climbers, 
                    do carry bottles or packs of water to ensure that they stay hydrated at all times. In order for mountaineers
                     to reach the top of the mountain, they risk the danger of suffocation, hypothermia, avalanche, etc...
                      Accidents may happen unexpectedly and this may cause complications like altitude sickness because 
                      altitudes vary when climbing and descending mountains.  In this page we will go through the most
                       basic equipment needed for hiking, to decrease people from getting into potential dangers,
                        the rules we must follow, and the way to get to the mountains around Sarajevo (Trebević, Visočica, Bjelašnica)
                         and the largest mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Maglić. </p>

                <h1>Trebević</h1>
                <p class="textarea" style=" text-align: justify;
                text-justify: inter-word;">
                An easy walk to the top of Trebević as an excellent escape from the city smog. After the "Hotel Pino ", take the asphalt road and then turn left through the forest for a more pleasant walk. You can also continue on the right on asphalt/macadam.  Here you can continue straight on the road (in the direction of the macadam/asphalt path) to the top of Trebević (approx. 1.5h) or you can turn towards "Dobre vode" and go uphill towards the mountain lodge "Jure Franko". Here is a description of how to get to the mountain lodge then you will get to the peak. 

                Continue straight along the well-trodden path and reach the part where the macadam intersects the path, continue only straight and reach the crossroads along the beaten wet path.
                
                After continuing on the straight path leading to the lodge, follow the markings that are on the trees or on the stones every 5 to 10 meters.  You have a way to continue to the top of Trebević (the peak of the Sofa) or continue to the lodge. In the lodge, you can find a place to sit and drink tea, but if you head to the top you will get a perfect view of Sarajevo.
                
                The path to the peak leads over a hill and let your landmark be the telecommunication tower which has 60m height and the peak of the Sofa has 1627m height . If you decide to go back at any time, just follow the markings and the path from where you came from and do not deviate from the path.

              <p class="textarea" style=" text-align: justify;
              text-justify: inter-word;">
               Mountain Visočica is surrounded by rivers  Rakitnica, Neretva, and Ljuta, as well as the mountains of Bjelašnica, Treskavica, and Prenj. 

               The easiest way to get to the mountain is via Bjelašnica, after reaching Bjelašnica you head towards the road leading to Šabići then to Tušila. You will notice that the road is getting narrower and narrower. Continue on the paved road until you reach the red marking on the left and point to the top of Vito. Continue to follow the markings, which are also paved, and usually go by car all the way to the stone stands where you will see "Vrh Vito" and an arrow written in red letters. You can leave your car in that area and head to the top following the markings. After 200 meters you will notice a large stone on which it says in red letters "Bivak" with an arrow to the left and if you continue right you will reach the top of Vito which is 1960m high. "Bivak" is made as a shelter from the storm. On the way, you will see a lot of water descending down the rocks and at the top a beautiful view of the mountains surrounding Sarajevo.

              <h1>Bjelašnica</h1>
              <p class="textarea" style=" text-align: justify;
              text-justify: inter-word;">
               Bjelašnica or as the locals say the Olympic mountain with the highest point called the observatory is 2067 meters above sea level. It is not difficult to climb Bjelašnica by car or bus, but it should never be underestimated for young mountaineers back in 1962. Observatory (2067m) is the highest summit on Bjelašnica. There are several ways to reach it, but this time we chose the route Babin do - Štini do - observatory. You can reach Babin do by car from Sarajevo, via the road to Bjelasnica, and once you arrive you can park your car there. After two kilometers of the gentle upward slope, you reach "Štini do". This is where the "House of Salvation" is located, a dilapidated shelter above which the ascent begins. After you turn right from the shelter you will notice three transformer stations leading to the top, which can serve as a visual clue. The trail itself is very strenuous and rather steep, the ascent is constant, and the higher up you climb the stronger the wind. The transformer stations can serve as wind shelters for short breaks. The Observatory is just a few hundred meters away from the third transformer station, the last in the row. Here the wind can make it difficult to move, so you should be extremely careful. In the observatory building, there is a room where you can rest and get some refreshments. It is clean and warm, and the employee on call usually offers the fallenwalkers some tea or coffee. You can return via the same route..In 1962, one of the greatest mountaineering tragedies in the former Yugoslavia took place. A group of eleven people, members of the sports section "Naša krila" from Zemun and the mountaineering association "Željezničar" from Sarajevo set out for Bjelašnica on November 29, 1962 " The oldest member was 31 years old, and the others were between 15 and 19 years old. Seven mountaineers, five from Zemun and two from Sarajevo were killed. Eleven young men, set out for Bjelašnica on December 2, 1962, to record the area of ​​the mountain with a camera for the documentary "White Death". The lives of seven of them were interrupted by white death. The organization was bad, the people of Zemun were poorly trained and shod, some were even in moccasins, and the leader of the action was poor orineted.
 They ignored the janitor's pleas "not to go to the top because bad weather is brewing" - which led to death in a snowstorm speed of 160 km / h. This is proof that the mountain should not be underestimated.  </p>

              <h1>Maglić</h1>
              <p class="textarea" style=" text-align: justify;
              text-justify: inter-word;">
                Maglić is the highest mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2637m of height. 
                It was named after the famous fog that is formed so quickly and which is there for an average of 300 days a year. 
                It is located on the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Montenegro. This mountain overlooks a heart-shaped lake called "Trnovačko Lake".
                 This ascent takes place - in the direction of Poštar, from Lokva Dernečište (1,642 m) to the top - category (difficult trail) around 3 h. 
                 Activity plan:  From the direction of Sarajevo, drive along the road M18 Sarajevo - Brod Na Drini 75 km (Foča)  then,
                  M20 road towards Tjentište, 27 km - at the old gas station that is not working - turn left towards Dragoš Sedlo. 
                  Drive on the macadam road 18 km to the crossroads - left towards Dernečište, 1.58 km. The road can start from the Denečište field by following the marks. Since the tour is very demanding in terms of fitness, a good part of the trail is very difficult with a pronounced slope that requires caution and slower movement. Adequate mountaineering equipment is required to adapt to weather conditions and the direction of ascent. Helmet, Rope (trap) 3-4 m for personal insurance, 1 HMS carabiner REQUIRED, there must be at least one hiking guide and crampons and ice ax if there is snow. A hiking guide is a person who knows well the area where the trip is organized and who has passed several times from various directions, in all four seasons. After climbing with the help of a mountain guide, if there is no fog, you will have a view of Trnovačko Lake, which is formed in the shape of a heart. </p>
